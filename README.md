# EASEx 1.0

We offer _EASEx_ (Embodied Agents to Scaffold Education, _x_ = any data-rich domain, e.g., physics, medicine, psychology, astronomy) as a content-agnostic AIED infrastructure for scaffolding data-driven problem-solving in jupyter notebooks. With a few clicks, educational stakeholders can easily set up _EASEx_ to provide automated, personalized and in-situ social support to students delivered via embodied pedagogical agents. _EASEx_ draws on empirical Learning Sciences research on scaffolding students' learning and advances in embodied pedagogical agent design within educational technologies. We welcome requests for advice on integrating _EASEx_ in your courses and educational interventions.
